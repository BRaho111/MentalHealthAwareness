        <p>Bipolar disorder is a complex mental health condition that affects people's mood and energy, which is accompanied by feeling euphoric, energetic, or irritable, often accompanied by impulsive decisions and a decreased need for sleep. These episodes are constructed by periods of depression, marked by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, and difficulties concentrating. The unpredictable nature of these mood swings may disrupt everyday life, school, relationships, or work. The exact cause of Bipolar Disorder is unknown; genetic and environmental factors are believed cause it, however, the exact cause is unknown. Bipolar disorder is highly treatable; mood stabilizers or antipsychotics, combined with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy, may assist in managing symptoms and support long-term stability. Healthy routines &amp; a strong support system are important for living well with bipolar disorder.</p>
