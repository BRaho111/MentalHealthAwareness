    <h3>Understand and Seek Support</h3>
    <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental health disorder that profoundly impacts a person’ thought & behaviors. Core symptoms include hallucinations(hearing or seeing things that don't exist), strongly held beliefs(delusions), and unstructured thinking or speech, which can make communication and daily functioning difficult. Individuals may also experience flat affect(reduced emotional expression), social expressions, social withdrawals, and trouble motivating themselves. Schizophrenia tends to emerge in late adolescence or early teenage years, and its exact causes involve a combination of genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental factors. Treatment is available for managing symptoms, while psychotherapy, social skills training,and community support programs are in recovery and improving quality of life. Early interventions and ongoing support are necessary, and they can reduce the severity of the symptos nad allow individuals to lead fulfilling lives.
