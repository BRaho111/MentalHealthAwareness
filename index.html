    <h2>Review</h2>
    <q>I honestly don't see how this movie could impress anyone older than 10. Sure, it's colorful, lighthearted, and has a few crowd-pleasing moments - but underneath the cape and charm, it feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than the cinematic relaunch of an iconic hero. For a character as emotionally rich and symbolically heavy as Superman, this version felt oddly flat, even juvenile.</q>
    <br>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <Strong>Visual Effects:</Strong> Amazing Quality, the movie is extremely appealing to the eyes.    <br>
    <Strong>Acting:</Strong> Stellar performances with the main actor Henry Cavill displaying his talents.
    <br>
    <Strong>Music:</Strong> The music was lackluster and disappointing.
    <br>
    <h2>Critics Notes</h2>*The film felt rushed, overloaded plot, and goofiness.
    <br>Some scenes may not be suitable for children under 12.
